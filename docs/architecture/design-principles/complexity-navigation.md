# Architecture Complexity Management

## Context Layer Navigation Model

### Core Principle
**Logical centralization, physical decentralization** - Each repository owns its concern and bubbles up only what others need for navigation.

### Repository Responsibilities

**splectrum** (This Repo)
- **Role**: Navigation layer and context switching
- **Purpose**: Understanding overall structure to delegate
- **Not**: Micro-management or knowing everything

**splitil** (ITIL)
- **Role**: Service coordination and choreography
- **Purpose**: What talks to what, workflow automation
- **Bubbles Up**: Service registry, dependencies

**SPlectrum org**
- **Role**: Execution layer
- **Purpose**: How apps and APIs run
- **Bubbles Up**: Capabilities, interfaces

**InfoMetish**
- **Role**: Deployment layer
- **Purpose**: How things package and ship
- **Bubbles Up**: Deployment options, formats

**Carambah**
- **Role**: Composition layer
- **Purpose**: How components combine
- **Bubbles Up**: Solution patterns, configurations

**Sesameh**
- **Role**: Intelligence layer
- **Purpose**: How systems adapt and learn
- **Bubbles Up**: Automation capabilities

## Navigation Pattern

```
"I need to know about X"
    ↓
Check context layer (splectrum docs)
    ↓
"X lives in context Y"
    ↓
Switch to Y repository for deep knowledge
```

## Documentation Strategy

### Active vs. Archived

**Active Documentation**
- Concise, current state only
- Navigation and context switching
- Mature patterns with diagrams
- One question per document

**Archive Folders**
- Historical discussions
- Evolution narratives
- Intermediate work
- Housekeeping applied

### Preliminary vs. Mature

**Preliminary** (Working Documents)
- Thinking in progress
- No diagrams yet
- May change rapidly
- Located in `docs/preliminary/`

**Mature** (Stable Documentation)
- Proven patterns
- Diagram-supported
- Rarely changes
- Located in `docs/`

## Complexity Management Principles

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
Each repository solves its own problems. Don't mix concerns.

### 2. **Bubble-Up Information**
Repositories expose only what others need for coordination.

### 3. **Context Switching**
This repository enables finding the right context, not containing all contexts.

### 4. **Bootstrap Confidence**
Trust the spl1 solution for circular dependencies - demonstrate rather than debate.

### 5. **Document Maturity**
Only create diagrams and formal docs for stable, proven patterns.

## Three-Part Naming Evolution

**Current Challenge**: `[package]/[api]/[method]` feels heavyweight

**Future Work**: Add structure to make naming sensible as ecosystem grows

## Archive Management

**Implementation Repos**: Keep audit archives for compliance
**Documentation Repo**: Keep evolution archives with active housekeeping
**Principle**: Not everything needs keeping forever

## Key Insights from Discussion

### The Groan Permission
Explicit permission to complain when things become cumbersome - essential for architectural health.

### Reframing Complexity
Complexity is the feature, not the bug. Multiple repos enable proper separation of concerns.

### Navigation Over Knowledge
This repo is about knowing where to look, not containing everything.

### Exciting Challenge
Logical centralization with physical decentralization is hard but worthwhile - embrace the challenge.

## Future Checkpoint Questions

When architectural decisions arise, ask:
1. Which context layer owns this concern?
2. What needs to bubble up for navigation?
3. Is this pattern mature enough to document?
4. Are we mixing concerns that should be separated?
5. Is complexity serving a purpose or just accumulating?

*Remember: Keep challenging at the right times - architectural health depends on honest feedback about emerging complexity.*
