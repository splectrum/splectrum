## Roadmap for this repository

It is clear to me that we will need to decentralise into a multi-repository hierarchy, otherwise too many different ways of thinking are needed to manage this repository properly. However, in order to figure this out I think it is important to keep everything centralised until we are ready to decentralise. (this is alse a seed repository, for documentation and I think ITIL).

I really want ITIL workflows implemented in an efficient way. The pathway for that is the automation (choreography) that it planned. Because of the equivalence of the interactive CCAI mode and event driven choreography mode it will be possible to transfer responsibilities one by one - with oversight.  

I am starting to think that the knowledgebase is essential for ITIL processes to operate properly. This means that this seed repository will have to evolve into an ITIL repository with knowledgebase. (We start with knowledge (docs), evolve towards ITIL and then split into single concern ITIL repositories).

It is not yet clear how the decentralised ITIL repo structure will look like. But the aim is that documentation (knowledge) will be posted back to the level where it belongs (inbox / outbox pattern will be great communicator). For instance, an app repository keeps the documentation about the app and post a summary to the app registry repo for inclusion. This pattern can be used all the way up the logical hierarchy. Yes, there is a centralised - or better top-down - structure. However, there could be more than one as well. Still a lot to think about here. 

I am doing quite a bit of blue sky thinking here, new grounds. But these are the new grounds that one will be able to cover if the essentials of SPlectrum are properly sorted. I am running ahead of the game here, we first need to get a core structure going where responsibilities are successfully devolved to the choreography pattern. However, it lifts the veil somewhat on the future, provided we are able to deliver in the present :)

With the ITIL implementation we want to construct a sort of a thinking structure. Create single-concern reasoning contexts and linked them efficiently together. The communication within that structure is of paramount importance. One context must be able to request information (report or research of some sort) without having to think differently from what's going within its context. For freedom of thinking to succeed it must be present in a suitable - but bounded - context. 

## TDD Is King

Test driven development is king with AI. In fact, I would like to broaden it: test driven thinking / problem solving is king. A bounded context within which an AI is allowed to act independently - must have sufficient quality gates associated with it so that the outcomes from the AI initiatives can be sufficiently cross-validated. I remain deeply convinced that both PRINCE2 and ITIL have a very important role to play in the type of solution we want to build.

Sesameh will play an important role in this because it can shape the behaviour required for the appropriate TDD approach depending on the project type. Where claude-swift has its generic wow, with a project section for repo specific, it looks like this project specific will end up to be a project type specific section with some project settings. I created alreadh a claude-prince2 repo, I think more will follow. These will be 'partial behaviour' repos from which the project type constructs will be built. Of course, some may find their way into wow - the generic component. It would be nice if I could integrate my research and writing repos into the same structure.
