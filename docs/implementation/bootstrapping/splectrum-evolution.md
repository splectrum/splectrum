# SPlectrum Bootstrapping Strategy: Seed Repos to Component Separation

## The Bootstrapping Challenge

**Core Problem**: SPlectrum needs SPlectrum to build SPlectrum - a classic circular dependency that requires careful resolution.

**Solution**: **Seed Repo Strategy** - Start with all-in-one prototype repositories that evolve into separated components once architectural boundaries are mature and proven.

## Seed Repo Evolution Strategy

### **Philosophy**
```
Seed Repos (all-in-one prototypes) → Mature boundaries → Split into components
```

**Key Principle**: Don't separate until you understand the boundaries. Work with functioning prototypes, identify natural separation points, then extract components when interfaces are stable.

### **Benefits**
- **No premature abstraction** - Boundaries emerge naturally during development
- **Working system first** - Always maintain a functioning prototype
- **Iterative refinement** - Each seed repo teaches about the architecture
- **Reduced complexity** - Solve bootstrapping AND architecture simultaneously
- **Clear migration path** - Evolutionary rather than revolutionary separation

## Coordinated Bootstrap Strategy

### **Dual Extraction from spl1**
**SPlectrum AND InfoMetish** both have seeds embedded in spl1:
- **SPlectrum seed**: Execution engine, service apps, cross-app patterns
- **InfoMetish seed**: Zip exe wrapper functionality (release builds)

**Coordinated Extraction**: Both components extract from spl1 in parallel, maintaining working prototype until full separation validated.

## The Three-Phase Journey

### **Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Completed)**

#### **hello-splectrum**
- **Purpose**: Basic concept validation
- **Outcome**: Proved core SPlectrum concepts viable
- **Learning**: Initial understanding of DSL engine requirements

#### **spl0**
- **Purpose**: Hand-coded implementation of core modules
- **Key Components**: Execution pipeline implementation
- **Outcome**: Validated technical feasibility
- **Learning**: Deep understanding of execution model and module boundaries

#### **spl1** (Current Working Prototype)
- **Purpose**: Collaborative AI development with roadmap
- **Key Features**: 
  - Working execution pipeline
  - Core service apps integrated
  - Cross-app invocation patterns
  - Development workflow established
- **Status**: Active development, approaching extraction readiness

### **Phase 2: Architectural Clarity (Completed)**

#### **Organizational Structure Insight**
- **SPlectrum** - Create (execution engine, apps, APIs)
- **InfoMetish** - Package/Deploy (containers, P2P, installations)
- **Carambah** - Compose (solution assembly, configurations)

#### **Module-App Equivalence Insight**
- **Unified Development**: Same repository template for apps and modules
- **Flexible Deployment**: Stateful (app) vs. stateless (module) deployment
- **Simplified Architecture**: Single `app-*` repository type

#### **Cross-App Service Pattern**
- **Single Concern**: Each service app has focused responsibility
- **Development SE**: Preloaded with essential service apps
- **Clean Separation**: Business logic apps call service apps

### **Phase 3: Component Extraction (Next Steps)**

#### **Step 1: Coordinated Extraction (SPlectrum + InfoMetish)**
**Objective**: Extract both SPlectrum and InfoMetish components from spl1 simultaneously

**SPlectrum Extraction**:
1. **Carambah Repository Creation**
   - Create `dev-se-composition` repository in Carambah organization
   - Define composition configuration for Development SE
   - Include all essential service apps (test-runner, deploy-tools, validation-engine, etc.)

2. **Service App Separation**
   - Extract individual `app-*` repositories
   - Maintain cross-app service patterns
   - Validate development workflow continuity

**InfoMetish Extraction**:
1. **Zip Wrapper Extraction**
   - Extract zip exe wrapper from spl1 release builds
   - Create `infometish-zip-wrapper` repository
   - Maintain compatibility with spl1 packaging

2. **Multi-Target Foundation**
   - Prepare for container, P2P, and OS installer expansion
   - Establish packaging infrastructure
   - Maintain clean separation from development concerns

**Success Criteria**: Both SPlectrum and InfoMetish operate independently of spl1, with InfoMetish capable of packaging SPlectrum components

#### **Step 2: App/Module Separation**
**Objective**: Extract individual apps and APIs from spl1 into separate repositories

**Implementation**:
1. **Service App Extraction**
   - Extract `app-test-runner` repository
   - Extract `app-deploy-tools` repository
   - Extract `app-validation-engine` repository
   - Extract `app-object-builder` repository
   - Extract `app-audit-logger` repository
   - Extract `app-aux-dev-tools` repository

2. **API Wrapper Extraction**
   - Extract `api-*` repositories for external tool wrappers
   - Maintain AVRO schema definitions in each repository

3. **Core Engine Extraction**
   - Extract SPlectrum DSL engine components
   - Maintain execution pipeline and runtime

**Success Criteria**: Each component can be developed independently using the separated Dev SE

#### **Step 3: Bootstrap Validation**
**Objective**: Prove the complete bootstrap cycle works

**Implementation**:
1. **End-to-End Test**
   - Use separated Dev SE to build a new app from scratch
   - Verify cross-app service calls work
   - Confirm packaging and deployment functions

2. **Self-Hosting Validation**
   - Use separated components to rebuild Dev SE
   - Verify circular dependency is resolved
   - Confirm bootstrap process is repeatable

**Success Criteria**: Complete separation achieved, spl1 can be retired

## SPL1 Completion Roadmap

- **Stable Interfaces**: All cross-app calls have mature, documented interfaces
- **Working Service Apps**: All essential service apps function independently
- **Clear Boundaries**: Obvious separation points between components
- **Documented Processes**: Development workflows are well-documented
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing of all functionality

### **Migration Strategy**
1. **Parallel Development**: Build separated components while maintaining spl1
2. **Incremental Validation**: Test each extracted component individually
3. **Gradual Transition**: Move development to separated components progressively
4. **Legacy Support**: Maintain spl1 until full separation is validated

2. **Deploy Dev SE** to development environment
3. **Create New App** using separated Dev SE
4. **Verify Functionality** through complete development cycle
5. **Rebuild Dev SE** using separated components (self-hosting test)

## Success Metrics

### **Extraction Success**
- **Independent Development**: Each component can be developed without spl1
- **Cross-App Functionality**: Service apps work correctly across repositories
- **Bootstrap Completion**: Dev SE can be built from separated components
- **Development Continuity**: No workflow regression during transition

### **Architectural Success**
- **Clean Separation**: Clear boundaries between components
- **Unified Model**: App-module equivalence maintained
- **Service Pattern**: Cross-app services work as designed
- **P2P Ready**: Components suitable for distributed deployment

## Conclusion

This bootstrapping strategy transforms the circular dependency challenge into a natural evolutionary path. By building working prototypes first and extracting components only when boundaries are mature, we achieve both technical success and architectural clarity.

**Key Insight**: spl1 IS the bootstrap - it's the working prototype that builds the separated components that build everything else. This resolves the chicken-and-egg problem through evolutionary development rather than theoretical architecture.

The completion of spl1 provides the definitive roadmap to full component separation and self-hosting architecture.
