# TDD and Quality Gates Architecture

## TDD as Foundation for Automation

Test-Driven Development is not just a development practice but the core enabler for AI-enhanced automation in SPlectrum.

## Key Concepts

### Quality Gate Driven Development
- **Start with Success Criteria**: Define what success looks like before implementation
- **Tests as Specifications**: Tests define the contract and expected behavior
- **Automated Validation**: Every step can be automatically validated
- **AI-Friendly**: Clear success criteria enable AI to understand and verify correctness

### SPlectrum Engine Characteristics
- **Stateless Execution**: Each request is independent
- **Full Audit Trail**: Complete record of execution steps
- **Data Layer Auditing**: Track all data interactions
- **Error Replay**: Package errors with full context for debugging

### Error Replay Capability
When an error occurs, SPlectrum can create an error report package containing:
- Complete execution audit
- Data layer interactions
- Environmental context
- Ability to replay exact request execution outside original environment

## Ways of Working (WoW)

Sesameh defines the quality-driven ways of working:

1. **Define Success First**: Start with clear success criteria
2. **Create Quality Gates**: Establish checkpoints for validation
3. **Write Tests**: Implement tests that verify success criteria
4. **Build Implementation**: Create functionality to pass tests
5. **Continuous Validation**: Automated testing at every step

## Benefits for AI Automation

- **Clear Boundaries**: AI knows exactly what constitutes success
- **Verifiable Actions**: Every AI-generated action can be tested
- **Safe Experimentation**: Tests prevent AI from breaking systems
- **Learning from Errors**: Error packages provide training data
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in quality gates ensure reliability
