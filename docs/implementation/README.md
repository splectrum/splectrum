# Implementation Strategy

This section covers how to build and deploy the SPlectrum ecosystem, from bootstrapping to production.

## Bootstrapping Strategies

Evolution paths for core components:

- [**SPlectrum Evolution**](./bootstrapping/splectrum-evolution.md) - From seed repository to full engine
- [**InfoMetish Packaging**](./bootstrapping/infometish-packaging.md) - Multi-target packaging evolution

## Development Practices

Quality and methodology:

- [**TDD & Quality Gates**](./development-practices/tdd-quality-gates.md) - Test-driven development as automation foundation

## Implementation Approach

1. **Start Small**: Seed repositories with minimal functionality
2. **Prove Concepts**: Working prototypes before separation
3. **Evolve Gradually**: Add capabilities incrementally
4. **Maintain Quality**: TDD and quality gates throughout

## Key Principles

- **Pragmatic Evolution**: Build what works, then optimize
- **Circular Dependencies**: Solved through bootstrapping stages
- **Working Software**: Always have runnable code
- **Automation First**: Quality gates and testing automated from day one
