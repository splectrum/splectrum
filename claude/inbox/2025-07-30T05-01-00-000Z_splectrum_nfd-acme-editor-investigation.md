## Epic: New Functionality Development (NFD)

### Objective
Investigate the feasibility and implementation approach for integrating the Acme editor Plan 9 port with the SPlectrum platform, with primary focus on multi-window terminal application development patterns.

### Background
Acme is a unique text editor and development environment from Plan 9 that provides:
- Multi-window interface with integrated terminal capabilities
- Mouse-driven interaction model
- File system integration
- Scriptable interface through file system operations
- Minimalist design philosophy aligned with SPlectrum's modular approach

### Investigation Areas

#### 1. Multi-Window Terminal Integration
- **Primary Focus**: How Acme's multi-window architecture could enhance SPlectrum application development
- Evaluate window management patterns for concurrent SPL execution contexts
- Assess terminal multiplexing capabilities vs traditional terminal emulators
- Document interaction model between Acme windows and SPL pipelines

#### 2. SPlectrum Platform Integration
- Compatibility with existing `modules/spl/app/` framework
- Integration with `spl/execute/` pipeline system
- File system integration with `modules/spl/blob/` operations
- Command execution patterns through `modules/spl/command/`

#### 3. Development Workflow Enhancement
- Integration with existing TDD workflow (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
- Support for batch file testing and rapid iteration patterns
- Enhancement of `spl/app/exec -f {file}.batch` workflow
- Multi-context development scenarios (parallel feature branches)

#### 4. Technical Feasibility
- Plan 9 port availability and stability on target platforms (Linux/Windows/macOS)
- Dependencies and system requirements
- Performance implications for SPL execution contexts
- File system integration patterns

#### 5. Architecture Considerations
- How Acme's file-system-based interaction model aligns with SPL's modular architecture
- Potential for Acme as a development environment for SPL applications
- Integration with existing `modules/tools/` API pattern
- Mouse-driven vs keyboard-driven workflow implications for SPL development

### Deliverables
1. **Feasibility Report**: Technical assessment of Plan 9 port integration
2. **Architecture Proposal**: Integration approach with SPlectrum platform
3. **Prototype Implementation**: Basic Acme integration with SPL execution
4. **Development Workflow**: Enhanced multi-window development patterns
5. **Documentation**: Usage patterns for SPL application development in Acme

### Success Criteria
- Clear understanding of Acme's multi-window terminal capabilities
- Documented integration approach with SPlectrum platform
- Prototype demonstrating SPL execution within Acme environment
- Assessment of development workflow enhancement potential

### Epic Context
This investigation aligns with NFD (New Functionality Development) epic goals of exploring innovative development environment enhancements for the SPlectrum platform, particularly focusing on multi-context development scenarios and improved developer experience.

### Priority
Medium - Research and prototyping phase for potential major development environment enhancement.
