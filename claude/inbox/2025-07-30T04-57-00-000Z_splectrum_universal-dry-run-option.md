# Universal dry-run option for command execution

## Problem Statement
SPlectrum commands can have side effects (file operations, network calls, system changes) that developers want to preview before execution. Currently, dry-run functionality is implemented inconsistently across different commands. There's a need for a universal `--dry-run` option that provides predictable behavior across all SPlectrum commands.

## Key Questions to Investigate
1. **Execution Record Integration**: How should dry-run interact with SPlectrum's execution record system?
2. **Side Effect Prevention**: Should dry-run be passed to underlying method calls to prevent side effects, or handled at a higher level?
3. **Output Modes**: Should there be verbose and non-verbose dry-run options?
4. **Alternative Approach**: Would it be sufficient to stop side effects and return the execution record as output?

## Required Work

### 1. Analysis of Current State
- Audit existing dry-run implementations across SPlectrum codebase
- Document current execution record structure and capabilities
- Identify all potential side effects in command execution pipeline

### 2. Design Investigation
**Option A: Execution Record Based**
- Stop side effects at high level
- Return complete execution record as stdout output
- Leverage existing audit capabilities

**Option B: Propagated Dry-Run**
- Pass `--dry-run` flag down through method call chain
- Each method handles dry-run internally
- Provides more granular control but requires more implementation

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Verbose mode: Propagated dry-run with detailed output
- Non-verbose mode: Execution record output only

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- Define universal dry-run interface
- Determine integration points with execution pipeline
- Design output format for different verbosity levels

## Work Plan

### Phase 1: Research and Analysis
- Map all SPlectrum command side effects
- Analyze execution record completeness for dry-run purposes
- Study existing dry-run patterns in codebase
- Benchmark performance impact of different approaches

### Phase 2: Design and Prototyping
- Design universal dry-run architecture
- Create proof-of-concept implementations for each approach
- Test integration with existing execution record system
- Define output format standards

### Phase 3: Implementation Decision
- Compare approaches based on:
  - Implementation complexity
  - Performance impact
  - Developer experience
  - Maintenance overhead
  - Completeness of dry-run information

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete analysis of current dry-run implementations
- [ ] Execution record capability assessment for dry-run use
- [ ] Prototype implementations of different approaches
- [ ] Performance benchmarks comparing approaches
- [ ] Recommendation for universal dry-run architecture
- [ ] Documentation of design decisions and trade-offs
- [ ] Implementation plan for chosen approach

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Integration level: High-level pipeline vs method-level propagation
- Output format: JSON execution records vs human-readable text
- Verbosity levels: Single mode vs multiple output modes
- Backward compatibility with existing dry-run implementations

### Performance Implications
- Overhead of dry-run flag propagation
- Memory usage for execution record collection
- Impact on command startup time

### Development Experience
- Consistency across all commands
- Ease of adding dry-run to new commands
- Debugging capabilities for command development

### Implementation Complexity
- Changes required to existing codebase
- Testing strategy for dry-run functionality
- Migration path from current implementations

## Context: SPlectrum Execution Model
SPlectrum's execution pipeline already captures comprehensive execution records including:
- Input parameters and arguments
- Method calls and return values
- File system operations
- Network requests
- Error conditions and exceptions
- Timing and performance metrics

This existing instrumentation may provide a foundation for sophisticated dry-run capabilities without requiring extensive method-level changes.

## Success Metrics
- Universal `--dry-run` works consistently across all SPlectrum commands
- Developers can predict command effects before execution
- Zero side effects occur during dry-run execution
- Output provides sufficient information for decision making
- Implementation adds minimal complexity to command development
