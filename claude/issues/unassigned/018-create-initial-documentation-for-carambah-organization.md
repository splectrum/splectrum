# Create initial documentation for Carambah organization

## Description
Create 1-2 pages of initial documentation for the Carambah organization covering its role in solution composition. Document simple component setups, complex vanilla solutions, compositions of SPlectrum engines and 3rd party tools, mixed compositions, and business logic definitions. Explain how Carambah creates environment-agnostic compositions using vanilla dev configs and serves as the high-level solution assembly layer.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Critical for v0.1.0 milestone - Carambah bridges the gap between low-level components and complete solutions

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** (solution template documentation)
**Blocked by:** (documentation structure task)
**Related:** (SPlectrum, InfoMetish documentation tasks)

## Effort: M
**Estimate:** Moderate complexity covering composition patterns and solution assembly strategies

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Carambah organization overview page created
- [ ] Simple component setups (single SPlectrum engine) documented
- [ ] Complex vanilla solutions (multi-component orchestrations) explained
- [ ] Compositions of SPlectrum engines documented
- [ ] 3rd party tool compositions with SPlectrum API wrappers explained
- [ ] Mixed compositions (engines + containers + P2P + tools) covered
- [ ] Business logic and workflow definitions documented
- [ ] Environment-agnostic vanilla dev configs approach explained
- [ ] Role in solution assembly and component composition documented

## Work Area: v0.1.0
**Context:** Carambah serves as the solution composition organization, taking components from SPlectrum and creating complete solutions that InfoMetish can then package for deployment.
