# Create SPlectrum/spl0 Repository One-Pager

## Description
Create a one-page overview document for the SPlectrum/spl0 repository in the org-repo/SPlectrum/ folder. This is the development wrapper that preceded spl1 in the evolution.

Document should include: repository purpose as development wrapper, relationship to spl1 evolution, current status, and role in the bootstrapping journey from Phase 1 to Phase 2.

## Priority: MEDIUM
**Justification:** Important for understanding SPlectrum evolution and bootstrapping strategy

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** None
**Blocked by:** Org-repo folder structure creation
**Related:** spl1, hello-splectrum repository one-pager tasks

## Effort: S
**Estimate:** Small effort - single repository overview document

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Created org-repo/SPlectrum/spl0.md one-pager
- [ ] Explains role as "wrapper within which SPlectrum is developed"
- [ ] Documents relationship to spl1 evolution
- [ ] Notes position in bootstrapping phases (Phase 1 validation)
- [ ] Current development status
- [ ] Relationship to hello-splectrum and spl1
- [ ] Consistent format with other repository one-pagers

## Work Area: org-repo-structure
**Context:** Development wrapper in the SPlectrum evolution chain: hello-splectrum â†’ spl0 â†’ spl1
