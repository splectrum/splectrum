# Create initial documentation for InfoMetish organization

## Description
Create 1-2 pages of initial documentation for the InfoMetish organization covering its role in packaging and deployment. Document container-based deployments as authoritative source, P2P packaging using Pear platform, plain install packages, and deployment templates. Explain how InfoMetish packages any composition for deployment across different platforms and serves as the distribution mechanism for the ecosystem.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Critical for v0.1.0 milestone - InfoMetish handles the crucial packaging and deployment aspects that make SPlectrum compositions accessible

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** (deployment workflow documentation)
**Blocked by:** (documentation structure task)
**Related:** (SPlectrum, bare-for-pear documentation tasks)

## Effort: M
**Estimate:** Moderate complexity covering packaging strategies and deployment patterns across multiple platforms

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] InfoMetish organization overview page created
- [ ] Container-based deployment strategy documented as authoritative source
- [ ] P2P packaging and Pear platform integration explained
- [ ] Plain install packages and traditional OS installations covered
- [ ] Platform-specific deployment templates documented
- [ ] Container registry role as primary distribution mechanism explained
- [ ] Relationship with bare-for-pear for P2P capabilities documented
- [ ] How InfoMetish packages compositions from other organizations explained

## Work Area: v0.1.0
**Context:** InfoMetish serves as the packaging and deployment organization, taking compositions from SPlectrum and Carambah and making them accessible through containers, P2P networks, and traditional installations.
