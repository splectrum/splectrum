# Create initial documentation for bare-for-pear organization

## Description
Create 1-2 pages of initial documentation for the bare-for-pear organization covering its role in Bare runtime compatibility. Document JavaScript module conversions for Bare runtime (not Node.js), P2P networking foundations using Pear platform, starting modules like commandline-args and commandline-usage, and how it enables P2P capabilities throughout the ecosystem. Explain the relationship with InfoMetish for P2P packaging.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Critical for v0.1.0 milestone - bare-for-pear enables the P2P networking capabilities that are fundamental to SPlectrum's vision

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** (P2P networking documentation)
**Blocked by:** (documentation structure task)
**Related:** (InfoMetish documentation task)

## Effort: M
**Estimate:** Moderate complexity covering Bare runtime specifics and P2P networking foundations

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] bare-for-pear organization overview page created
- [ ] Bare runtime compatibility purpose explained (vs Node.js)
- [ ] JavaScript module conversion strategy documented
- [ ] P2P networking foundations using Pear platform explained
- [ ] Starting modules documented (commandline-args, commandline-usage)
- [ ] Relationship with InfoMetish for P2P packaging explained
- [ ] How it enables P2P capabilities across the ecosystem documented
- [ ] Technical differences between Bare and Node.js runtimes explained
- [ ] Role in supporting decentralized application goals documented

## Work Area: v0.1.0
**Context:** bare-for-pear extends the ecosystem by providing Bare JavaScript runtime compatibility that enables true P2P networking capabilities, supporting the core vision of decentralized applications.
