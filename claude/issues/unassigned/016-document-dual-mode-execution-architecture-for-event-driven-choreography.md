# Document Dual-Mode Execution Architecture for Event-Driven Choreography

Objective
## Cross-Repository Task

**Source**: herma/sesameh/claude-swift  
**Type**: documentation  
**Created**: 2025-07-14T15:45:00.123Z  
**Priority**: HIGH

---

## Description
Create comprehensive documentation for the dual-mode execution architecture that supports both interactive (human-AI collaborative) and automated (event-driven) modes. This architecture is fundamental to the roadmap for transitioning from rigid workflows to event-driven choreography.

The documentation should capture the insights from our discussion about:
- Single pathway execution patterns
- Batch logging optimizations
- Event-ready design principles
- Collaborative debugging capabilities
- Progressive automation strategy
- Same logic guarantees across modes

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** This architecture pattern is critical for understanding the system's evolution from monolithic workflows to decomposed, event-driven tools. It explains why process emphasis is necessary now to enable future automation efficiency.

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** Future event-driven choreography implementation
**Blocked by:** None
**Related:** Workflow decomposition tasks, event system design

## Effort: L
**Estimate:** Large effort due to comprehensive documentation needed covering architecture, patterns, examples, and migration path

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Architecture overview document explaining dual-mode concept
- [ ] Optimization patterns documented (single path, batch logging, etc.)
- [ ] Collaborative debugging guide with real examples
- [ ] Migration roadmap from workflows to event choreography
- [ ] Code examples showing dual-mode tool implementation
- [ ] Benefits analysis for both interactive and automated modes
- [ ] Integration with existing workflow documentation

## Work Area: architecture-documentation
**Context:** This documentation captures a fundamental architectural insight: the current "rigid" workflows are building blocks for future event-driven choreography. The emphasis on process enables a system that can operate efficiently in automated mode while providing powerful collaborative debugging capabilities in interactive mode. Key optimizations include:

1. **Single Pathway Execution**: Remove conditional paths for deterministic execution
2. **Batch Logging**: Collect operations and log once at completion
3. **Event-Ready Design**: Each operation as a potential event trigger
4. **Mode Abstraction**: Same rules work for both interactive and automated execution

The collaborative mode is essential because it makes the invisible visible - allowing us to debug production issues by walking through the exact same logic interactively, understanding not just what the system does but why. This creates a tight feedback loop where automated mode provides efficiency at scale while collaborative mode provides understanding and evolution.

Example files created during discussion:
- CLAUDE_OPTIMIZED.md (showed over-optimization losing collaboration)
- CLAUDE_COLLABORATIVE.md (balanced approach maintaining collaboration)
- CLAUDE_DUAL_MODE.md (final architecture supporting both modes)
- CLAUDE_COLLABORATIVE_DEBUGGING.md (debugging patterns and benefits)

The documentation should emphasize that this isn't bureaucracy but building a system that can teach us about itself while running efficiently in production.
