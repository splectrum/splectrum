# Create initial documentation for Sesameh organization and Claude-Swift integration

## Description
Create 1-2 pages of initial documentation covering the Sesameh organization's role in AI-driven behavioral intelligence and its relationship with Claude-Swift. Document how Claude-Swift enables collaborative AI creation (minds not hands approach), TDD-first workflows, and quality gate specifications. Include the connection between Sesameh's behavioral intelligence capabilities and Claude-Swift's practical implementation for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Critical for v0.1.0 milestone - Sesameh represents a core organizational pillar and Claude-Swift is the primary tool enabling collaborative AI development workflows

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** (other Sesameh documentation tasks)
**Blocked by:** (documentation structure task - should be completed first)
**Related:** (documentation structure task, README summary task)

## Effort: M
**Estimate:** Moderate complexity requiring documentation of abstract AI collaboration concepts and concrete Claude-Swift implementation details

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Sesameh organization overview page created explaining AI-driven behavioral intelligence
- [ ] Claude-Swift integration documentation covering collaborative AI workflows
- [ ] Clear explanation of "minds not hands" collaboration approach
- [ ] TDD-first workflow integration with AI assistance documented
- [ ] Quality gate specifications and how they work with AI documented
- [ ] Connection between behavioral intelligence concepts and practical Claude-Swift usage
- [ ] Documentation fits within established organizational structure
- [ ] Content is accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences

## Work Area: v0.1.0
**Context:** Sesameh serves as the behavioral intelligence organization enabling collaborative AI creation where humans define and AI implements. Claude-Swift is the primary manifestation of this approach, providing practical workflows for AI-assisted development while maintaining quality gates and TDD principles.

## Content Structure Suggestions

### Page 1: Sesameh Organization Overview
- **Purpose**: AI-driven behavioral intelligence and collaborative creation
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Minds not hands collaboration approach
  - Human-AI creative partnership model
  - Behavioral intelligence systems
- **Repository Types**: Claude CAI behavioral components, workflow definitions, quality gates
- **Role in Ecosystem**: Adds intelligence to any SPlectrum composition

### Page 2: Claude-Swift Integration
- **What is Claude-Swift**: Primary tool implementing Sesameh's collaborative AI approach
- **Workflow Integration**: How it works with TDD-first development
- **Quality Gates**: AI-assisted validation and testing frameworks
- **Practical Usage**: Examples of collaborative AI development workflows
- **Connection to SPlectrum**: How Claude-Swift enhances the execution environment
