# Create bare-for-pear/command-line-args Repository One-Pager

## Description
Create a one-page overview document for the bare-for-pear/command-line-args repository in the org-repo/bare-for-pear/ folder. This is a command-line parsing library adapted for Bare runtime.

Document should include: repository purpose for command-line parsing, conversion from Node.js to Bare runtime, relationship to P2P networking requirements, and role in bare-for-pear's JavaScript module conversion mission.

## Priority: MEDIUM
**Justification:** Core utility library for bare-for-pear organization - essential for P2P runtime compatibility

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** None
**Blocked by:** Org-repo folder structure creation
**Related:** Other bare-for-pear repository one-pagers

## Effort: S
**Estimate:** Small effort - single repository overview document

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Created org-repo/bare-for-pear/command-line-args.md one-pager
- [ ] Explains command-line parsing library purpose
- [ ] Documents Bare runtime conversion from Node.js
- [ ] Notes relationship to P2P networking requirements
- [ ] Describes role in JavaScript module conversion mission
- [ ] Links to bare-for-pear organization goals
- [ ] Consistent format with other repository one-pagers

## Work Area: org-repo-structure
**Context:** Command-line parsing library converted for Bare runtime P2P compatibility
