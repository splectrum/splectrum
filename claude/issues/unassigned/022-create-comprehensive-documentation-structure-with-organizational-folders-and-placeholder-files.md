# Create comprehensive documentation structure with organizational folders and placeholder files

## Description
Create the centralized documentation structure for the entire SPlectrum ecosystem with organizational folders (splectrum/, infometish/, sesameh/, carambah/, bare-for-pear/) plus cross-organizational sections. Reorganize existing preliminary documentation by moving development methodology files to claude/project/docs/ and product documentation to main docs/. Create placeholder files for each organizational section but do not populate with full content yet - separate tasks will be created for detailed documentation.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Essential foundation for v0.1.0 milestone - establishes centralized documentation hub structure that all future documentation tasks will build upon

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** (future documentation tasks depend on this structure)
**Related:** README.md summary task

## Effort: L
**Estimate:** Large scope involving directory structure creation, file organization, and multiple placeholder files across 5 organizations plus reorganization of existing content

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Documentation structure created with organizational folders (splectrum/, infometish/, sesameh/, carambah/, bare-for-pear/)
- [ ] Cross-organizational sections created (architecture/, guides/, reference/)
- [ ] Development methodology files moved to claude/project/docs/
- [ ] Product documentation files organized in main docs/
- [ ] Each organization folder has README.md placeholder with organizational purpose
- [ ] Main docs/README.md serves as navigation hub for entire ecosystem
- [ ] All placeholder files have consistent structure and clear "TODO" sections
- [ ] File reorganization preserves all existing content

## Work Area: v0.1.0
**Context:** Based on discussion of centralized documentation strategy where this repository serves as single source of truth for entire SPlectrum ecosystem documentation, with clear separation between product docs (docs/) and development methodology docs (claude/project/docs/)

## Implementation Details
