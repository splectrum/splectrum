# Create initial documentation for SPlectrum organization

## Description
Create 1-2 pages of initial documentation for the SPlectrum organization covering its role as the execution engine and tool integration hub. Document the DSL engine, unified API architecture, AVRO-based schemas, streaming architecture, and how SPlectrum provides the execution foundation for all ecosystem components. Include repository types (api- prefixed wrappers, app- prefixed applications) and naming conventions.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Critical for v0.1.0 milestone - SPlectrum is the core execution foundation that all other organizations build upon

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** (ecosystem integration documentation)
**Blocked by:** (documentation structure task)
**Related:** (other organization documentation tasks)

## Effort: M
**Estimate:** Moderate complexity covering technical execution engine concepts and API architecture

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] SPlectrum organization overview page created
- [ ] DSL engine capabilities and architecture documented
- [ ] Unified API architecture explained (APIs vs Apps)
- [ ] AVRO-based schema foundation documented
- [ ] Streaming architecture and Kafka compatibility explained
- [ ] Repository types and naming conventions (api-, app- prefixes)
- [ ] Role as execution foundation for ecosystem documented
- [ ] Connection to P2P application development explained

## Work Area: v0.1.0
**Context:** SPlectrum serves as the core execution environment where all tools and apps are accessed through standardized APIs, enabling AI-friendly development and stateless execution with full audit trails.
