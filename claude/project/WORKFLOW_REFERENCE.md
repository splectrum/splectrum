# Workflow Reference - Splectrum Project Workflows

Reference guide to project-specific workflows that extend the base Claude Ways of Working system.

## Project-Specific Workflows

Currently, this project uses only the base WoW workflows with no project-specific extensions.

| Workflow | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| *(none)* | - | No project-specific workflows defined |

## Base WoW Workflows

**Important**: This project inherits all base workflows from the Claude Ways of Working system.

For complete workflow reference, see: `../wow/WORKFLOW_REFERENCE.md`

**Available base workflows include:**
- Session management (SESSION_START, SESSION_END)
- Development workflows (COMMIT, GIT_WORKFLOW, DOCUMENTATION_WORKFLOW, OPERATIONAL_RULES)
- Issue management (ISSUE, CREATE_ISSUE, CLOSE_ISSUE, NEXT_ISSUE, ISSUE_CACHE)
- Release management (RELEASE, FULL_RELEASE, PATCH_RELEASE, VERSION_TRANSITION, NEW_VERSION_PLANNING, VERSION)
- Task management (INBOX, OUTBOX, TASK_CREATE)

## Workflow Inheritance

### Extension Pattern
Project workflows extend but do not override WoW workflows:
- **Project-specific needs**: Would be handled by workflows in this directory (when created)
- **Base functionality**: Inherited from `../wow/workflows/`
- **Trigger integration**: Project triggers work alongside WoW triggers

### Script Integration
Project workflows may use:
- **WoW scripts**: `../wow/scripts/` for base functionality
- **Project scripts**: `scripts/` for project-specific implementation (if needed)

## Usage

**Trigger Information**: See `../CLAUDE.md` for user-friendly sesame triggers  
**Base Workflows**: See `../wow/WORKFLOW_REFERENCE.md` for inherited workflows  
**WoW Scripts**: See `../wow/SCRIPT_REFERENCE.md` for available implementation scripts
