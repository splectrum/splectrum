# Project Documentation

This directory contains operational documentation specific to working within the SPlectrum repository.

## Repository Ways of Working

- [**Documentation Standards**](./documentation-standards.md) - Writing style, structure, and quality guidelines
- [**Visual Documentation Guide**](./visual-documentation-guide.md) - Standards for diagrams, colors, and visual consistency
- [**AI Collaboration Patterns**](./ai-collaboration-patterns.md) - Effective patterns for working with AI in this repository

## Purpose

These documents define HOW we work within this repository, as opposed to WHAT we're building (which is documented in `/docs`).

## Quick Reference

### Documentation Principles
- **Concise**: Essential information only
- **Practical**: Real examples over theory
- **Visual**: Diagrams preferred over text
- **Evolutionary**: Grows with the project

### Visual Standards
- Use Mermaid for architecture diagrams
- Follow organization color palette
- Keep diagrams simple and clear

### AI Collaboration
- Express intent through natural language, visual flows, or DSL
- Use iterative refinement
- Reference existing patterns in the codebase
